#### Sync Watched configuration
Sync Watched service will sync the watch status between Plex and Emby users. Requires Tautulli and Jellystat to work. Define a plex user name to sync to an emby user name and vice versa.

| sync_watched | Function |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| enabled       | Enable the sync watch service |
| cron_run_rate | Rate at which to run this service. Cron format but only uses minutes and hours |

| can_sync_plex_watch | This should be True for the admin user of the server only |
| emby_name | The emby user name to sync watch status |

#### Delete Watched
Plex by default does not allow users to delete media. This service was intended to be used on a TV Recordings library but can be used however you want. Define a set of libraries and users. If the service detects an item has been watched by a defined user it will delete the item after a defined time period.

| delete_watched | Function |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| enabled           | Enable the delete watched service |
| cron_run_rate     | Rate at which to run this service. Cron format but only uses minutes and hours |
| delete_time_hours | How long to wait in hours after a show has been watched to delete |
| users             | A list of users to monitor for watched status |
| libraries         | A list of libraries to monitor for defined user watches |

1 to many users can be listed for sync watched
| users | Function |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |

| utilities_path    | The path in the media-utilities container that corresponds to the plex or emby library media |

#### DVR Maintainer
Plex and Emby have a very basic DVR function for removing media after a certain amount of time or a max episode limit. This service expands on this and allows you to specify a max number of episodes or a length in days a episode is allowed to be on the server.

| dvr_maintainer | Function |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| enabled           | Enable the delete watched service |
| cron_run_rate     | Rate at which to run this service. Cron format but only uses minutes and hours |
| libraries         | A list of libraries to monitor for media deletion |

1 to many libraries can be listed for dvr maintainer
| libraries | Function |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| plex_library_name | Name of the plex library to notify on media deletion (Optional) |
